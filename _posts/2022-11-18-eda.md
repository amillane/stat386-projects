 #Introduction 
 
John Tukey once said, “The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” There is something beautiful about taking a hodgepodge of data and transforming it into a story. What we could not see is now unveiled for us to discover and ask more questions. In other words, exploratory data analysis propels curiosity and discovery. Excitedly, this power can be harnessed with a few lines of code. 

As discussed in my previous blog post, weather patterns have a major impact on all we do, especially in this time of drought. With the scraped data we get to split the clouds and explore! In this post, I have shared five graphics that help display patterns in our dataset, each with a question in mind. Let’s begin! 

#How much precipitation did Provo get this year? 

The graph below displays the amount of precipitation Provo received in inches starting at the beginning of this year. From what we can see at first glance it hasn’t rained very much here in Provo. The highest is 0.6 inches per hour, which is considered heavy rainfall. What is surprising is that occurred during June, not in April which I would have assumed the heaviest rainfall to be at. It appears that rainfall occurs most often during March through April and September through October, ranging from light to moderate rainfall. What would be interesting to see is comparing this graph to another state like Oregon and comparing rainfall occurrence and how severe.
